## Proposal Summary
Proposal for Boss DAO to acquire and hold various Old Money NFTs, including "$0.2 Bills". 
Old Money is a rock solid community with founders that, despite how it may seem on the surface, are treating the project as a business.
Potential future for Old Money: NFT Staking, Market place, Cardano Staking pool and more.

**Example 1:**
We propose the Boss DAO utilizes between 5,000 and 10,00 ADA of treasury funds to purchase an assorment of floor assets from the various Old Money drops, including Campaign Materials, The Inflation Times, and $0.2 Bills.
At time of writing, all Old Money NFT drops currently released are sitting slightly above mint price, if not 6-10x original mint price.

**Example 2:**

We propose the Boss DAO develop a discord bot to assign the “DAO NFT Owner” role to confirmed DAO members.


## Proposal Details
*Answer the following questions, and add any other relevant information.
What will the Boss DAO do?
Why should the Boss DAO do this? What does the DAO stand to gain? Include mathematical figures.
How will the treasury be involved? How much will be spent? How long will treasury funds be vested in the assets proposed?
Ideally, when should the vote on this proposal be held?*

**Example 1:**
We propose the Boss DAO utilizes between 5,000 ADA of treasury funds to purchase an assorment of floor assets from the various Old Money drops, including Campaign Materials, The Inflation Times, and $0.2 Bills.

The goal would be to not spend the entire amount allotted, and to hold that as reserve to mint and/or purchase floor assets of upcoming Old Money mints, to complete sets to sell either individually or as asset bundles.

Several more NFT drops are planned through the end of 2022, with one sometime in April and another in May.

Alternatively, assets purchased, could be held to be utilized in the NFT Marketplace and Staking feature for profit sharing which is planned by Old Money. 
There have been discussions in the Old Money Discord that the marketplace and staking might resemble something like what is seen with Mutant Croc and Epoch Art.

Less than a month ago in March of 2022, the Old Money $0.2 Bill floor was around 150ADA. 
By the beginning of April 2022, the floor had risen to nearly 600ADA before settling to near 500ADA at time of writing.


Old Money Volume Figures:

1.7M ADA Volume across all drops
- Inflation Times: 374k ADA Total volume; 12k ADA ATH sale; Typical mint price 50ADA, Floor 51ADA; 5.6k assets on policy, 1643 unique wallet holders
  Policy ID: a4c45615825acae7c4937ee4d45d2ff9a29328084e2dc34bf4af37b2
  
- Campaing Materials Volume: 221k ADA Total volume; 7k ADA ATH Sale; Typical Mint price 40-50 ADA, floor 42 ADA; 5k assets on policy, 749 unique wallet holders
Policy ID: 2aec93fa65aaedaf2fc0aa46c3ace89c0c8e091ed5f39b8f8127e664

- $0.2 Bill Volume: 1.1M ADA Total Volume; 33k ADA ATH Sale; Mint Price 80 ADA, Floor 480 ADA; 7.5K assets on policy, 1242 unique wallet holders
Policy ID: 3bcc312ebe7cd9281ab3e3d641bf70f207012e539b0e6e7c3f1560d7


Rationale:

Old Money is a project which has been building since late 2021. One of the main founders has recently doxxed in an interview with youtuber Block is Hot. 

Details about the project have been hidden in the form of clues and teasers in previous NFT drops, specifically in 'The Inflation Times' NFTs. 
Holders of 'The Inflation Times' NFTs will be airdropped special tokens, the utility of which is speculated to be used for the Old Money staking pool and future NFT staking planned for the project.

In the interview with Block is Hot, the Old Money founder describes that he does not view NFT Projects as "Projects" but rather as a business, and the developer(s) as CEOs.

Old Money has developed a unique giveaway system, which can require participants to join specific Discord Channels, not just the Old Money Discord

Old Money has "Gameified" the holder experience by creating a system which ranks users by how many Old Money NFTs they hold. 
Community members are constantly acquiring Old Money NFTs to rise in rank amongst the community. 
Many of the NFT drops are released with variations which result in mini "collections" which people inevitably try and acquire.

Those are just some of the reasons I believe that factor into the reason that all Old Money NFTs are currently right at, or slightly above mint price, in all cases where they aren't already 6-10x


We propose the Boss DAO utilizes 10,000 ADA of treasury funds to sweep the (ExampleASSET) floor. 

(ExampleProject) is an P2E project that has been traded for over 1.4m ADA on jpeg.store and will be released their P2E game soon. They recently released a trailer for the game which caused their floor to rise from 100 ADA to 175 ADA, a 75% increase in value. It is likely their value will increase more when the game fully releases.

Additionally, owners of the (ExampleProject) NFT will receive (ExampleProject) token airdrops on (Date). These tokens will be the in-game currency and will likely appreciate in value as the game matures and grows in popularity.

Up to 10,000 ADA will be used to buy the lowest priced (ExampleAsset) on jpeg.store. The purchased NFTs will be held until May 1st, exactly one month after their game & token release. At that point, the DAO will vote on whether to sell or continue holding the assets and/or token.
    
Ideally, the vote should be held the week of (Date)

**Example 2:**

We propose the Boss DAO develop a discord bot to assign the “DAO NFT Owner” role to confirmed DAO members.
This discord feature would allow owners to easily be identified during discord interactions, letting users see who is and isn’t a member of the DAO. Certain channels and features could be made accessible to DAO Members only, such as a private voting discussion channel.

The application should be developed so that it works with any Cardano NFT, asset, or policy ID. This would enable the bot to be easily used by other CNFT discords, helping to foster goodwill between the general CNFT community and the Boss DAO.

This proposal will not require funds from the treasury. The vote could be held at any point.
